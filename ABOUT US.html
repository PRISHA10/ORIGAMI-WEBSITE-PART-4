  INFORMATION ABOUT ORIGAMI<br>
Origami is the art of paper-folding. 
Its name derives from Japanese words ori (“folding”) and kami (“paper”). 
Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into 
a sculpture without cutting, gluing, taping, or even marking it.<br>

CHINA<br>
Paper was invented in China around 105 AD, and folded paper—or zhezhi—most likely emerged shortly after.
 By 900 AD, paper yuanbao, or gold nuggets, were a staple at traditional Chinese funerals.
 Created by meticulously folding gold or yellow paper into ingot currency, these ephemeral ornaments were crafted with the intention of being thrown into a fire at the end of the ceremony.
 Eventually, paper-folding would become a common practice. 
 Though similar to Japanese origami, more modern Chinese paper-folding exhibits an interest in representing inanimate objects, 
 like boats and boxes.

 JAPAN<br>
 Paper was introduced to Japan in the 6th century. 
 During this time, the practice of paper-folding emerged as a ceremonial Shinto ritual. 
 It was not until Japan's Edo Period (1603 – 1868) that origami would also be viewed as a leisurely activity and art form   
 Like Japanese woodblock prints—an art form that also saw popularity during this time—origami works often featured flowers, birds, and other nature-based motifs. These subjects are also prevalent in contemporary origami, which remains true to the traditional Japanese practice in all ways but one: originally, the practice allowed artists to strategically cut the sheets of paper. 
 Today, however, true origami is sculpted entirely through folds—an attribute the Japanese adopted from Europe.
